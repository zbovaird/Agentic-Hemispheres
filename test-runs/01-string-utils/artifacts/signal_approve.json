The self-correction was appropriate — the unicode test expectation was ambiguous in the contract ('handles unicode by stripping non-ASCII'), and the Emissary resolved the ambiguity by aligning with the literal constraint rather than assuming normalization. This is correct Left Hemisphere behavior: literal interpretation over implicit meaning."
