  "failure_pattern": "Acceptance criterion 'chunk must handle async iterables' conflicts with architectural constraint 'No async functions. Return types must be synchronous arrays.' Consuming an AsyncIterable<T> requires `for await...of`, so chunk would need to be async and return Promise<T[][]>, which violates the constraint.",

    "Implemented unique and chunk as pure synchronous functions; 5/6 tests pass (unique and all non-async chunk tests).",
